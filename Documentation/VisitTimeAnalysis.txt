*Note* See the screenshot file for the graph created

Graph-
    The graph seemed to form an exponential curve, which was a bit suprising for me. I expected a 
bit more of a linear increase. I wouldn't have been suprised if there was a bit of an exponential
curve, but the slope was much more than I expected. Another suprising thing was the datapoints on
the 40 and 50 person per hour frequencies. I can't explain why both seem to deviate from the trendline
so much. If anything, it seems that the 50 person frequency is closer to the line and the 40 person
datapoint is off somehow. The problem may lie in how I designed my algorithm that randomly selects people
to become patients.

Doctor and Nurse Comparisons-
*Note*: frequency of visits was set to 30
1 Doctor, 1 Nurse: 1hr, 52min
1 Doctor, 2 Nurses: 0hr, 21min
2 Doctors, 1 Nurse: 0hr, 16min

    The results of the doctor and nurse number comparion suprised me a bit. I expected that the 1 
doctor, 2 nursevcombination would be the most efficient as the nurses have a shorter average treatment
time. But it seems like high-priority patients having to wait for one doctor outwieighed the doctor's
longer treat times. I was also a bit suprised on just how much of a difference is between having two
and three providers. I expected maybe a 20 or 30 minute difference, but a difference of over and hour
shows just how far a little extra help can go.
